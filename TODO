features we have to implement:

- use better the _original variable: maybe create a function forcing the _processed to be emptied

- manager of databases: create a load_database function, stacking all the matrices on _processed
    -> a variable indicating the number of matrices stored
    -> a variable indicating the labels of the different matrices (such as the years)
    -> since we have a public google drive where we store the data, would be nice to automatize their download...

- add the documentations properly

- add in the plot_graph routine(s) the possibility to define the descriptions

- a routine removing the empty rows and columns

In prediction module
- The class should return the vector field relative to the state matrix at a fixed delta_t.
- The class should take as input a vector of sigmas (one relative to the Fitness direction and one relative to the GDP direction).
- The class should handle a vector of weights (one relative to the Fitness direction and one relative to the GDP direction).
- The two previous points can be generalized to N different dimensions
- The class should be able to find those points which the predicted distro is not gaussian but multimodal.
- Estimate the errors
